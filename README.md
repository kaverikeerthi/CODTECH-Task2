# Project Overview
## Project:
      Deep Learning Model for Image Classification

## Objective

To develop a Deep Learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images accurately. 
The goal is to build a robust image classification system that can learn from labeled image data, 
process it using deep neural layers, and make predictions on unseen images.

## Key Activities
### Import Libraries

* Loaded essential libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.

### Data Preparation

* Loaded image data from directories using ImageDataGenerator.

* Preprocessed images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

### Model Compilation and Training

* Compiled the model using adam optimizer and categorical_crossentropy loss.

* Trained the model on the training dataset with validation monitoring.

### Model Evaluation

* Evaluated the trained model using accuracy and loss metrics.

* Visualized training and validation curves (loss/accuracy vs epochs).

### Prediction and Testing

* Used the model to predict classes of new/unseen test images.

## üíª Technologies Used

##  Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the use of Deep Learning with CNNs for image classification. The model was trained and evaluated on image datasets, showing the ability to learn patterns from visual data. This pipeline‚Äîfrom loading data to prediction‚Äîlays the foundation for more advanced computer vision tasks like object detection or multi-class image recognition.
